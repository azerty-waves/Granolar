# Granolar

Granolar is a machine learning project that reconstruct grains of sound, it is executable with Python3.

## Installation

See the requirements folder for the compulsory libraries

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## To train the model, run

```bash
python3 vae_main.py
```

## To load the trained model and start the synth
Run one of the following scripts:

\- recover_model.py

\- recover_model_batch.py

You need to have pyo installed, and also wxpython to have the pyo gui. Just run:

```bash
pip3 install pyo
pip3 install wxpython
```
The file simple_OSC_control.pd is a Pure Data patch for sending simple OSC messages to control the synth. To control recover_model.py you need to send one element tuples of floats in the range (0,1). To control recover_model_batch.py you need to send tuples of 16 floats in the range of (0,1).
